# Next.js Frontend Initialization

The goal is to set up a modern, high-performance Next.js frontend in the `frontend` directory of the CIMS project.

## Proposed Changes

### [Frontend]

#### [NEW] [frontend](file:///d:/workstation/dev/server/www/cims/frontend)
- Initialize Next.js using `npx create-next-app@latest`.
- Use TypeScript, ESLint, and App Router.
- **Note**: I will avoid TailwindCSS as per system instructions unless explicitly requested. I will use Vanilla CSS with a rich aesthetic.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- Run `npm run dev` and verify the home page loads with a premium design.
- Check for any build errors.
